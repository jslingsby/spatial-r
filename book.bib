  abstract  = "The loss of natural habitat resulting from human activities is
               the principal driver of biodiversity loss in terrestrial
               ecosystems globally. Metrics of habitat loss are monitored at
               national and global scales using various remote sensing based
               land-cover change products. The metrics go on to inform
               reporting processes, biodiversity assessments, land-use
               decision-making and strategic planning in the environmental and
               conservation sector. We present key metrics of habitat loss
               across South Africa at national and biome levels for the first
               time. We discuss the spatial patterns and trends, and the
               implications and limitations of the metrics. Approximately 22\%
               of the natural habitat of South Africa has been lost since the
               arrival of European settlers. The extent and the rate of habitat
               loss are not uniform across South Africa. The relatively mesic
               Grassland, Fynbos and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biomes have lost
               the most habitat, while the arid Nama-Karoo, Succulent Karoo and
               Desert have lost the least. Rates of loss increased across all
               biomes in recent years (2014--2018), indicating that the
               historical drivers of change (i.e. expansion of croplands, human
               settlements, plantation forestry and mining) are intensifying
               overall. We should caution that the losses we report are
               conservative, because the land-cover change products do not
               capture degradation within natural ecosystems. Preventing
               widespread biodiversity losses and securing the benefits we
               derive from biodiversity requires slowing and preventing further
               habitat degradation and loss by using existing land-use planning
               and regulatory tools to their full potential.",
